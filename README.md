# Paintcraft (paid package info)

Hello and welcome everyone interested in this project. 

I just want to let you know that some time ago I started work [on one more coloring book](https://appshowcase.intel.com/en-us/allinone/paintcraft) and after that I decided to make a unity package. It works very smooth and fast on every kind of device you can check it right now in your borwser. Please check following links:

* [Webgl Live version](http://paintcraft.in/live/)
* [getting started guide](http://paintcraft.in/start/1/)
* [AssetStore](http://u3d.as/tJ4)

and here is a screenshot of how brush are configured there. you have a full control of every point and you can make any kind of effects.

![Complete project inside](https://d2ujflorbtfzji.cloudfront.net/package-screenshot/13da4cde-216b-499b-8741-4af912667bbb_scaled.jpg)

It support multitouch and you can make application for several players and let them draw in the split screen mode on the same or personal canvases

If you have any questions, you can ask them in the [Unity3D Forum](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/paintcraft-drawing-app-constructor.404998/) or drop me e-mail.

thanks.

I've used screenshot manager in the game, but main plugins packages are excluded, you can replace this functionality or buy it [here](http://u3d.as/4pz), or [this is a good candidate](https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/iosnativecodesamples/src/a0bc90e7d6358e456caf25d717134864218740a7/Graphics/AsyncScreenshot/?at=stable) for ios plugin replacements

# p.s.

I hope you will find something useful for you in this project, like localisation package, floodfill algorithm, floodfill animation. After couple of coloring book projects for another companies, requirements grew constantly, and after latest project, I see huge gap between what i did on colorus and what i've done for big company. drawing solution on colorus is not ideal but not so bad =). 

Good luck for your coloring books, and many interesting kids software for all of us =) !!!
