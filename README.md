I've used screenshot manager in the game, but main plugins packages are excluded, you can replace this functionality or buy it [here](http://u3d.as/4pz), or [this is a good candidate](https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/iosnativecodesamples/src/a0bc90e7d6358e456caf25d717134864218740a7/Graphics/AsyncScreenshot/?at=stable) for ios plugin replacements

# p.s.

I hope you will find something useful for you in this project, like localisation package, floodfill algorithm, floodfill animation. After couple of coloring book projects for another companies, requirements grew constantly, and after latest project, I see huge gap between what i did on colorus and what i've done for big company. drawing solution on colorus is not ideal but not so bad =). 

Good luck for your coloring books, and many interesting kids software for all of us =) !!!
